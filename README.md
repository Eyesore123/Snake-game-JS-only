## Planned improvements

* Better stylings for snake / buttons
* WASD-keys for controls
* Random spawns for snake
* Enemies
* Settings menu: snake speed, grid size etc.
* Better tablet compatibility
* Leaderboard
* Customizable controls
* A higher framerate by reorganizing game logic
* Viewport fixes and better scaling for higher resolution screens
* Improved background effects that are applied to bg image

## Known issues

* Ease-in-out effect of the background image doesn't work on Mozilla, so images change abruptly. I tried to replace body with a div for the location of background images. I also tried pseudoelements, but nothing worked.
* Game can lead to game over suddenly in rare instances when some unknown combination of keys is pressed and the game over condition gets triggered prematurely.
